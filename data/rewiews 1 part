When I first downloaded this app I thought it was fake until I tried it I would never know what was going on when I had a pain in my chest but then I saw this and I was like oh what does this app do and I read some of the reviews and I thought for a moment and I just looked at it and decided that I would try it out and it works really well so I would suggest that other people that has a problem like random pains to see what’s going on with your heart and then tell it to your doctor to get it checked out, love this app.

1st time user of this app and I’m amazed by the brilliance design in this health monitoring app. As a patient that went thru a major heart surgery, it’s like seeing most of all the devices used on my operation are stacked and loaded up in this one app. ‘ now I’ll be a daily user.

While you are performing the test. It is natural that you will be conscious, concerned and exited a bit. That is bound to cause a sort of deviation from normal!! I don’t know if this factorized while making the conclusions on one’s heart condition😐
06 September, 2023 at 7:28 AM
If you are experiencing something similar to 'white-coat anxiety' that leads you to feel more stressed when you are taking a measurement, the easiest way is to make the experience a regular one so that your body can adjust. HRV measurements are best taken in the morning before any strenuous activity while you are still feeling relaxed.

This app is amazing especially for people with epilepsy like me because your heart rate changes during a seizure and before one happens it’s a warning sign one coming and another good thing about the app is heart rate can also slow down or even temporarily stop so the app can keep track of that and keep u updated u can look back on your graph and show your doctor

At first I was like there is no way this is really real but I tried it the first time I tried it I just got off work and I was really tired and stressed and the app said energy low and stress very high and I took another try today and today I had no work or school and I just relaxed and the app said energy high and stress low. I highly recommended this app!!

I love this app! It’s been helping me know myself lately, and helps me worry less, but I don’t think the tension a energy and stress level thing is accurate.
23 August, 2023 at 5:33 AM
Thanks for the review. Stress, tension and energy are all calculated based on various parameters of heart rate variability, and they reflect the physiological markers of your heart and nervous system. If you perform the measurement according to the instructions and get results that you don't think are correct, please send us a report from the app so that we could look into it!

I really like to monitor my heart rhythm. I have checked my heart beat at different times in one day. I was just so curious about what's on the app. Before going to see a cardiologist I am reading on this app, I am on five day challenge, I added my lab result I got on the app. I am not on the three days trial but I want to see more things the app will enable me to do. Thank you guys.

Would be 5 stars if I had the feature to export my data to the phone so I can track all other vitals in my health app, please add these feature and I even pay for it. Other than that very good app, would recommend.

This app gave me the information I needed right away, very good. I don’t agree with the subscription fee, $6.99 a week. I do understand that is pays to stay healthy but I do think majority of people would prefer a monthly subscription instead. Just a thought.

I have just started using this app and find it to be very useful. There is a ‘but’ hence not 5* at the moment. Some of the information is too low contrast I.e. very feint grey. Some of it is so minute and can’t be read without a magnifying glass!
12 February, 2023 at 12:30 PM
Thank you for the honest review. It would be helpful if you could let us know which information you found was hard to read, so we could try to improve the design.

Different HRV by twice the amount on Apple Watch
Fordham flashed
I cannot understand that my Apple Watch HRV score is almost half of every score on this app. I updated both products and they both measure ms. Every measure is like 35 in apple health and Fitbit and 68 here Why the difference?
05 February, 2023 at 7:50 AM
That's a really good question! Truthfully, there is no set standard as to what counts as "HRV" per se, so different apps have their own relative measurements of it. If you want to compare, it's best to go with looking at the raw, scientific values you see at the bottom of the measurement, such as SDNN and RMSSD. Even when scientists deal with HRV, they have to define which specific measurements of HRV they are working with. I hope that helps!

I look forward to the future when there's more. The subscription price is a bit expensive. But it seems almost everything is available in the free version.

17 January, 2023 at 7:19 AM
Dear customer, Unfortunately, blood pressure measurements can be done via a specialized device. That is because there has not been enough research proving any other methods as reliable. Same goes for temperature: it can only be measured via a specific sensor. If you do have a blood pressure monitor at home, you can record your measurements into Heartify and then export your measurement history for your next doctor visit.

Ne remplace pas un avis médical
cv1957
Les mesures faites à partir de ce logiciel ont de cela de très intéressant, c’est qu’elle vous donnent l’état réel de certaines mesures concernant votre santé cardiaque et permettent en cas de résultats anormaux de tirer la sonnette d’alarme et de consulter rapidement un professionnel de la santé. Donc ne remplace en aucun cas une expertise médicale, mais est un excellent donneur d’alerte en cas de problème.

I’ve tried many other heart rate monitors and even downloaded some for blood pressure but ended up deleting afte 2 minutes due to low accuracy, complicated interface and extremely high cost for no gaddamn reason. Heartify is by far the best I’ve tried and I’d rather pay for a subscription on this app because it’s too good, better than others and totally free

So far it’s been helping me realize how bad of health I am in and how fatigue and stress my body is , so doing the challenges that are actually very easy because to me if it’s too hard, I’m not gonna do it and just seeing some improvement in my heart health and my energy level has been helping me a lot, so I think it’s really worth having this because at certain age we have to switch over from being able to do a lot of things we used to be able to do and now getting to an age where I really need to take care of myself and keep my stress level down, so I highly recommend this I really like it a lot

Here’s where the story starts. So I was playing those 1 star games to see what their like. Obviously, there is millions of ads and I’m not surprised. I get the heartify ad and I think it’s cool. So I downloaded it and I tried, then the screen in only made for phones and that’s horrible. If you add an extension for an iPad that would be nice, and more people would likely go on your app.

Şaşırtıcı Derecede Başarılı
ShoryuReppa
Açıkçası bu uygulamayı ihtiyacımdan değil, doğru ölçüyor mu diye merakımdan indirdim. Fenix 7 saatim ile karşılaştırma yaptım. Nabız ve HRV değerleri birbirine çok yakın çıktı. Sadece stres ölçüm algoritmasının elden geçmesi gerek çünkü Garmin çok düşük stres (12) gösterirken bu uygulama yüksek stres uyarısı verdi.

Hello i tried this and thout is worked but i tried it on my pillow and it showd a heartrate Thank you for lying
30 November, 2022 at 5:10 PM
Hi! It's great that you take an inquisitive approach but it's a bit more complicated than that. Heartify measures your heart rate by tracking light changes in your finger as blood moves through your capillaries. When you hold the camera to the pillow, there are still small light changes that can be detected. However, that does not speak anything against measurement quality, because Heartify is heavily optimized for use with your index finger (not for pillows!). It's like taking your dog to see a pediatrician. Sure, the doctor knows where all the organs are located, but they're used to treating kids, not puppies!

Me sorprendió muchísimo:
Fox Yuman
Cuando escuché sobre la aplicación no pensaba que fuera posible medir el pulso con solamente la cámara de mi teléfono.. pero me sorprendió mucho cuando pudo medirlo con mucha precisión y me encanta el hecho de que no solo mide el pulso sino que mide otras cosas como el estrés, la presión etcétera y me sirve mucho ya que puedo saber con más exactitud mi condición física. por ende le doy 5 estrellas.

This is a false commercial swindle
dvlaskin
This is a humiliation for users. We want truthful information. And we're not exactly fools, as the developers think. There may be harm from conclusions. The application does not have the right to give a conclusion about variability, because it works with the pulse from the camera. Measurement within 2 minutes cannot register many parameters, for example VLF. It's not literate. The application does not use the age norm. For example, the pNN50% indicator in 50 years may be 0. This greatly distorts the result. I am ashamed of the people who decided to make money on the health of people. And I can read articles for free
14 November, 2022 at 10:13 AM
Dear Customer, Heartify measurements are based in scientific evidence. Ultra-short-term HRV measurements provide enough data to perform spectral analysis and single out LF, HF, and VLF parameters. As for the age norm, users are asked to enter their age and gender in order to adjust the measurement to available norms. Surely, there are more accurate ways for monitoring HRV, but most require wearing dedicated devices or measurement in a professional setting. PPG measurements allow people to monitor their health without the extra hassle and the need to delve into the details of scientific research just to check their HRV parameters.

07 November, 2022 at 6:30 AM
Thank you for your honest review! Unfortunately, there is still not enough scientific evidence to support measuring blood pressure with a phone's camera and for now, your best bet is buying an arm-cuff monitor. What Heartify can help you with is neatly storing your BP data and exporting it for your doctor.

El estrés que ves en la aplicación es tu estrés fisiológico y no necesariamente tu estrés emocional. El estrés proviene de su sistema nervioso simpático que mantiene su cuerpo alerta. El estrés elevado puede indicar una mayor actividad de su sistema nervioso simpático.

A Good App but…
sloughsteve27
I’ve started to use this app on an almost daily basis. It took a bit of time to win me over but I’m slowly getting there even while using the free version only. The only major downside to it though is the subscription pricing. Simply way too expensive. If it was £5.99/month, I’d subscribe. And I’m sure many others would too. But at £5.99/wk, that is simply just taking the pee…

Cool Big Daddy #1
Most apps claims to be and do something they aren’t and do not do, not this app. Most of time it is spot on at detecting and acutely informing me of not only how I feel but why I’m feeling that way along with suggesting as to how to feel better. When I first saw the $65 price I was sticker shocked, $65 for an app. You have to be me, I thought. But I have to say, it is well worth the price. I look at it first thing in the morning when I awake and several times throughout the day when I notice I’m not feeling my best. I highly recommend this app to anyone who are interested in being aware of their body and are interested in feeling better.

Hallo, en bedankt voor je beoordeling. Het spijt ons voor het ongemak. Onze app heeft bewezen een positieve invloed te hebben op de levensstijl en het welzijn van gebruikers na enkele maanden gebruik. Het algoritme voor zelftraining heeft tijd nodig om je te leren kennen en hoe meer gegevens het heeft over je lichaamstoestand, activiteiten en gewoonten, hoe effectiever het wordt. Sommige functies zijn in eerste instantie misschien niet beschikbaar, maar worden toegankelijk naarmate de app meer gegevens verzamelt en persoonlijke inzichten biedt. Daarom hebben we besloten om het maandelijkse plan geleidelijk van alle platforms te verwijderen, en het is al gearchiveerd in de App Store.

Hi, and thanks for the feedback. We're glad you like our app. As for translation, we have a lot of content and translating it to another language is a resource-demanding task. If we have enough requests to translate to any specific language, we will add it to our roadmap and might translate it in the future.

gowther.s
I love the app, it’s a great idea and development. Unfortunately, I can’t budget a hundred dollars right now and wanted to subscribe monthly. The monthly subscription option is not allowing me to change the pricing. Please change, so I can purchase.
04 October, 2023 at 6:04 AM
Hello, and thanks for your feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience. The thing is that our research indicates that most users experience significant improvements in their lifestyle and well-being within several months of using our app. The self-training algorithm improves over time as it gathers data about your body, activities, and habits, so the results are more effective in the long term. Some features may not be available initially but become accessible as the app collects more data. To better serve our users, we're going to remove the monthly plan and it's no longer available on App Store.

Hi, and thanks for the feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience this situation may have caused. Our research shows that with most users, our app helps achieve significant positive changes in their lifestyle and well-being within several months. Our app is more effective in the long term, as the self-training algorithm needs to get to know you, and it takes time and data about your body's state, activities, habits, etc. to form baselines. Moreover, some features only become available later on in your journey with our app, when there is enough data to provide you with interesting findings (e.g. personalized research that shows how two data sets affect each other based on your individual health and wellness data from the sources you've connected to the app). That's why we're going to gradually remove the monthly plan from all platforms, and we've already archived it in App Store.

I Love This App
masked&vaxxed
Health shouldn’t be so expensive. I can’t afford to pay almost 100$ per year just to use an app. If it was priced at lifetime for that amount then it would make more sense to purchase. Lowered to 4 star due to annual cost
02 October, 2023 at 7:49 PM
Hello, and thanks for the feedback. Welltory is a sophisticated product. It packs complex algorithms and decades of health research. Making the app efficient and convenient for every user requires a highly qualified, world-class team, including in-house health scientists, data researchers, and engineers whose work is not and should not be cheap. We also have a free version of the app and promos with discounts fairly often; stay tuned for those!

Deep insights and meaningful prompts for greater self-knowledge.
Tothintl
This app has already started to change my life by bringing more awareness to the patterns in my life, balance of energy and sources of stress. I signed up for ‘lifetime’ membership after two weeks! The charts and graphs that digest and present HRV data are super informative—one request—please correct graphic / contrast issues so they are more legible! The small dark text is hard for me to read. Would be great if these graphs could be blown up full screen. Thank you and keep up the great work!!

I did learn the importance of having good stress in your life and that some is needed to maintain a healthier heart ( something like that ). This is a great app by far!!

Hello and thanks for the review! Welltory tries to let you know when you physically need rest and recovery, but everyone is different, and it's possible that what you're seeing is simply your healthy norm. It's also okay for your results to show that you're stressed or overworked after a workout or a hard day — it happens to the best of us. What matters is that you can make a full recovery afterwards.

Have been using the free trial and looked to purchase as trial was only 2 days. Was disappointed to find that I could only choose the annual subscription. Having only been able to trial for two days, I am still undecided if I want to make such a financial commitment and would love the option of a monthly subscription to really get to know the app first.

Hi there, and thanks for your feedback! Kindly note that Welltory is not a medical app, and it can't be used for diagnostic purposes or as a substitute for professional medical advice. However, if the quality of your measurements is high, they should reflect how your body's doing pretty decently.

This app has really showed me how high my stress is on a constant basis and I’ve tested it out thinking it that it can’t be right but my test proved that this app is very accurate and it’s helped me to really work on my health and stress because I think when your stress so much your body just doesn’t know how to not stress. Unless you really work on it physically, and mentally. So I really think this app is worth it for your health and stress or whatever else you can get out of it, the tips they give you are great also A++++

Hello and thanks for the review, we appreciate the insight. It's important to note that Welltory's goal is to offer a clearer picture of how your body is doing from a lifestyle perspective, not a medical one. We are not a medical app and cannot diagnose any medical conditions, although we've received positive endorsements from professionals in the field. Our platform is designed to help you understand when your body needs rest and recovery, as your conscious experience may differ from your physiological state. That being said, if any part of our app causes you stress or anxiety, please know this isn't the intended effect. We're very open to your feedback and encourage you to reach out if something feels off.

Take in consideration of heart diseas
Klmnuio
Hello, dos the Welltory app take into consideration heart disease, bypass surgery, high BP, heart medications one is on when analyzing ones health journal?
22 September, 2023 at 12:25 AM
Hello! Generally, if you have cardiac dysfunction or elevated heart rate episodes and are taking a measurement during an arrhythmia episode, the accuracy may be low, and the measurements can be filtered out from the journal. Cardiac dysfunction affects your heart’s work and your heart rate variability. In this case, our algorithm can’t accurately analyze the state of your autonomic nervous system or the balance of its sympathetic and parasympathetic parts, so it can't gauge your body’s state either. Besides, our algorithm can’t yet distinguish between arrhythmia and a bad signal. So, if you sometimes have an arrhythmia or elevated heart rate episodes, it may take you several tries to take an accurate measurement. If you don't have a continuous irregular heartbeat, you can successfully use Welltory in between episodes. As for medications - you can record medication intake using tags and then track their impact on your metrics.

EliHSilva
O aplicativo me pareceu muito bom, tem muitas métricas interessantes, ele ajuda bastante a interpretar os dados colhidos pelo Apple Watch. Mas a assinatura em reais está fora da realidade, 1500 reais a assinatura vitalícia é algo impossível a se pagar por um aplicativo e quase 600 reais por 1 ano é igualmente surreal. Sugiro repensar esses preços.

Never been normal!
Zero Turn
These last few years have been epiphany to me. I had a stroke in 2007 and I’ve had TIAs And other vascular issues as recently as 23 weeks ago. In 2011 I went I went to a procedure to to Discover I had a bundle branch blockage of the first degree. That is the electrical signal in my heart measures three beats instead of four. I believe I was born with that. The latest issue is I have a clot in my left in my leg the big one I’ve been placed on Eliquis and told not to do any lifting, and I’ll be on that medication for six months. I fight with my live girlfriend. She said she was going to have a job and then she quit and I think she’s somewhat of a grifter. I am amazed at how well wellatory knows I’m under stress. The important thing is that sometimes I am on stress and I don’t even realize it but that is but that is par for the course when you grow up the way, I did in a very violent neighborhood and high stress working environments.

Desde hace dos días me siento con dolores de espalda, de cabeza y sudores. Además de dolor de garganta. Y desde hace dos días mi estado de salud en la app estaba al 40% y aveces menos. Pues siguiendo la recomendación de mi mujer me hice un test de COVID. Y di positivo. Ahora sí que creo que este tipo de app te da pistas reales sobre tu estado de salud actual. Un 10

Sam Thorpe
If you want to be seen, understood and cared about - this is the app for you. The analysis and personalised support are not only accurate, but I felt that I was not struggling on my own. Validation for stress and tiredness with help and support to feel better… detailed - and I mean DETAILED data analysis and layman’s terms presentation with relevant information and suggestions. This is the first app to properly explain HRV in context and present solutions. Better than any other coaching app, stress app, HRV app. Take care of YOU and get this app!

Sneaky subscription
Quoosron
The app does what it says. I have no complaint there. However, it does not present itself on your subscriptions list in Settings, and cancelling your subscription is otherwise is I chore. I had to go into the support section of the app and chat with a bot to find a link to cancel my subscription. There is no link in the app otherwise to be able to do this. And that happened because I got billed without warning. I really don’t like companies with this approach.

This app has been a lifesaver in so many ways. Through a notification, Welltory will warn me when I’m starting to disregulate, and it allows me to self treat with CBT or Welltory provided mediTation that is tailored to your reported symptoms rather than use more pharmaceuticals. I love the features that allow you to add symptoms to your day, moods physical wellness, and then it sends all your information over to Apple health and you get a cumulative health report for your day. With the information from Welltory, I’ve been able to plan my days as to how my system is functioning. When my tank is red, I’m already feeling crappy but with disregulated moods that flip on a dime lately I’m untrusting of my senses so when my tank is green, I have more confidence to push myself. Of course, the reason I need this app has landed me on disability and the affordability of this app, even at 40% off is for me it’s only downside.

Hallo, en bedankt voor je feedback. Onze excuses voor het ongemak. Ons onderzoek wijst uit dat de meeste gebruikers binnen enkele maanden na het gebruik van onze app aanzienlijke verbeteringen in hun levensstijl en welzijn ervaren. Het algoritme voor zelftraining verbetert na verloop van tijd naarmate het gegevens verzamelt over je lichaam, activiteiten en gewoonten, dus de resultaten zijn effectiever op de lange termijn. Sommige functies zijn in eerste instantie mogelijk niet beschikbaar, maar worden toegankelijk naarmate de app meer gegevens verzamelt.

i think its impressive how much data this app can give from your heart rate, and how it calculates it, however i downloaded this because recently my heartbeat has been more noticeable, irregular and fast but because of those factors it keeps saying that the measurements' quality are low. i do also like though how it can connect to your health apps and give more information. all in all i think its a good app
30 August, 2023 at 3:26 AM
Hello, thank you for your feedback. Your heart condition can indeed affect the accuracy of your measurements.

I didn’t know about the importance of measuring HRV before this app, and it has been enlightening when syncing with my apple watch and health data. I wish it had more insights of my cycle as a woman. I had had questions and the team is very responsive and nice. For nerdy people about body, stress and performance is amazing. And they are constantly improving it. It’s expensive but I’ve found it worth it :)

Hi there, and thank you for your review and kind words! It means a lot to us. Please note that you can synchronize data from other apps with Welltory, and track your body conditions throughout the cycle. You can also add labels about your state to your feed, and this will also be reflected in your feed and journal.

Hi, and thank you for your feedback. Our research shows that with most users, our app helps achieve significant positive changes in their lifestyle and well-being within several months. The app is more effective in the long term, as the self-training algorithm needs to get to know you, and it takes time and data about your body's state, activities, habits, etc., to form baselines. Moreover, some features only become available later on in your journey with our app when there is enough data to provide you with interesting findings (e.g., personalized research that shows how two data sets affect each other based on your individual health and wellness data from the sources you've connected to the app). That's why we're going to remove the monthly plan from all platforms gradually, and we've already archived it in App Store.

Hi there. Thank you for your kind words! Welltory is a complex product. It packs complex algorithms and decades of healthcare research. Making the app effective and usable for every user requires a world-class, highly skilled team, including full-time health scientists, data researchers, and engineers, whose work cannot and should not be cheap. We also have a free version of the app.

Schöne App aber zu teuer
AllyMcBeal77
Eine App mit guten Einsichten in meinen Körper. Schöne, ansprechende Aufmachung. Am Besten gefällt mir der Energie-Level, der bildlich dargestellt wird und in der Regel immer mit meinem eigenen Empfinden überein stimmt. Man bekommt öfter „30% Off“ angeboten, die ich gerne in Anspruch nehmen würde, allerdings wird eine komplette Eingabe der Kreditkartendaten fällig und läuft dann irgendwie nicht mehr über den App Store. Da ich nicht weiß, ob ich dann das Abo wieder einfach kündigen kann, lasse ich es lieber. Zum vollen Preis ist mir die Vollversion zu teuer.

stacy v
I love this app. I got it on the start of my health journey and can see how my health stays high even when my stress and energy are low when it didn’t in the beginning. So my body is handling stress better than before, like exercising. ***the main thing I would like to change is a way to change your waking hours. I work nights and it’s always telling to get rest because I’m up late. It also thinks work is my home, I work in a 14 acre plant and if I walk to a different part it says I’ve left home

Would love to have the option of subscribing on a bimonthly basis - annual subscription fee too high for me And you should adjust your subscription rates to the purchasing power of each country - as was the norm in the good old days Thus you will enroll a wide spectrum of subscribers instead of limiting thinly yourselves at the top higher end of the market Considering the statistical deviation from the average EU you could establish yourselves as the winner takes it all since you’ll be the first one to do that
16 August, 2023 at 10:33 AM
Hello, and thanks for the review. As for the prices, your feedback is appreciated and noted. As for the subscription, our research indicates that most users experience significant improvements in their lifestyle and well-being within several months of using our app. The self-training algorithm improves over time as it gathers data about your body, activities, and habits, so the results are more effective in the long term. Some features may not be available initially but become accessible as the app collects more data. To better serve our users, we have decided to discontinue the monthly plan, so it's no longer available on App Store.

Only one thing which does not make sense! My coherence, it is always low! I wonder why! My heart and brain are almost never connect! Everything else is terrific! I really love welltory! 100% recommended 🤍
15 August, 2023 at 2:53 PM
Hi there! Thanks for the feedback and for the high ratings. Coherence shows how synchronized your brain, heart, and respiratory system are. When your systems are synced up, you are less irritable, tend to think more rationally and work more effectively, are ready to make important decisions and complete complex tasks, and feel balanced in general. Better coherence may be achieved with breathing practices, such as coherent or deep breathing, as well as positive emotions and thoughts. Please contact us via in-app chat for useful videos that can help you improve the coherence scores. Take care!

Love the features - some a bit technical so a little over the lay person’s head but I’m learning on the fly. Can’t seem to get a handful of the “screens” whether phone or Apple watch that are advertised though. Example …. “beating heart” screen or “body analysis screen”
14 August, 2023 at 3:48 PM
Hello, thank you for your feedback! The main idea behind the ads is to showcase the app's functionality in the shortest period of time — Welltory has lots of features and they are hard to squeeze into one promotional video. Therefore, our ads offer an artistic representation of all the features available in Welltory. While these visuals might be stylized, they remain true to the core functionality of Welltory. We appreciate your understanding!

I have been having some medical problems so I wanted to track my heart rate and other metrics. This app is very in-depth. Gives me a lot more information than I was originally looking for and it has been very helpful. I do wish they had some explainer videos so the first few days I understood it better but I’m slowly figuring it out. Great app if you want to know what your body is doing and make sure you don’t over do it. Or when to hit the ground running.

Very interesting app
UJustMadeItWeird
Found this while looking for a similar app I used previously on my android phone years ago. I’m addicted to data, all kinds of data. Due to not caring and partying for 3/4 of my life with little to no exercise at all I have a lot of internet in my heart health especially. I’ve used a few of the popular HRV or heart rate apps out there and none seem to give you the level of detail you get in this one. I use very few paid apps as I have like no savings and it’s hard to justify the cost. This app I feel is totally worth the price (especially with 35% off as I got it. Even my doctor likes it when I was talking to him about it. I read a lot of scientific studies beyond just what this app referenced and both those and my doctor agree that outside of his office or the hospital this is the most accurate measurements available without spending a fortune on fancy machines to check heart health. While it won’t make up for the years of neglect it will help to minimize the issues that I will have by keeping me informed. Best part is that you learn so much more than just a number from this app and it’s so easy to learn and use. You get great insights into the metrics it’s reporting to you so you can understand the numbers it tells you. It’s up to you to incorporate the results into your health plan but as they say, knowing is half the battle. I’m hoping to get the Apple Watch so my sleep and everything can be analyzed as well. No matter what using this won’t make my health worse so it’s worth it. Check it out, the free trial period will convince you to go ahead and buy the pro version. At under a hundred dollars a year, which is taxable as a healthcare expense according to my accountant, it’s one of the better tools you will get for your health for that amount. Most people spend more on coffee in a month than a year of this costs. I recommend this to anyone who wants to stay on top of their health.

When I first started this app I was constantly getting the RED. High stress, low energy etc. I decided I needed to try and do something about it and started intermittent fasting….lost 40lbs got more sleep etc. I’m now getting normal results. Thanks Welltory!

Hi, I'm a fan of welltory. My Many Korean users around me are disappointed about the lack of Korean support. Nowadays, with AI technology, it is easy to have a multilingual translation system in the app. If Welltory has such a multilingual system, it will grow globally. Please add Korean or multilingual support. 🙏
12 August, 2023 at 6:20 AM
Hi, Currently, Welltory is not localized. The complete translation of the application is a mountain of work since we have a large amount of content. If we get enough requests to translate into your language, we'll add it to our roadmap for sure and probably translate it. Stay tuned for updates!

Die App ist sehr informativ und zeigt sehr viele Einblicke in meine Gesundheit. Leider ist mein Englisch nicht so gut, sitze oft mit dem Googleübersetzer an der App um schwierige Wörter zu übersetzen. Bitte macht die App auf Deutsch, sie hat so viel Potential. Es gibt keine vergleichbare App die so gut ist wie die.

Hoi, en bedankt voor je review. Onze excuses voor het eventuele ongemak. Het is bewezen dat onze app na enkele maanden gebruik een positieve invloed heeft op de levensstijl en het welzijn van gebruikers. Het zelftrainingsalgoritme heeft tijd nodig om u te leren kennen, en hoe meer gegevens het heeft over de toestand, activiteiten en gewoonten van uw lichaam, hoe effectiever het wordt. Sommige functies zijn in eerste instantie mogelijk niet beschikbaar, maar worden toegankelijk naarmate de app meer gegevens verzamelt en gepersonaliseerde inzichten biedt. Daarom hebben we besloten om het maandplan geleidelijk van alle platformen te verwijderen.

5 Stars! I very much appreciate the usage of the app especially when I have my Apple Watch on, and it tells me that something might be wrong with my heart or heart rate. It seems that this app is the most accurate of any app on heath. I do wish that their algorithms would sync to see when someone is in distress for longer than normal periods of time that it could notify someone in the medical community, as some people with limited incomes are probably not able to get the full benefits of the app.

Interessante Auswertungen
O2Kundin
Ich überlege mir die pro Version zu kaufen, bin allerdings noch nicht voll überzeugt, da sich in der Test Version für mich wesentliche Probleme zeigen. Die Daten sind sehr interessant und auch die eingeblendeten Tipps auf Basis der Ergebnisse finde ich sehr hilfreich. Allerdings funktioniert die Messung per Blitz bei mir überhaupt nicht, der Puls steigt angeblich rasant an und stoppt nicht (Bei anderen Apps funktioniert sie tadellos). Die „Wasserstandsanzeige“ wird nur unregelmäßig aktualisiert (heute zB noch überhaupt nicht), auch die manuelle Messung per Achtsamkeitsapp wird nicht geladen. Kann ich beides irgendwie beeinflussen?
05 August, 2023 at 2:29 PM
Hi. Vielen Dank für Ihr Feedback und Ihre netten Worte zur App – wir freuen uns darüber :) Wenn Sie Probleme mit den Messungen haben, könnten Sie uns bitte über die App kontaktieren? Tippen Sie dazu in Welltory auf Menu → Settings → Report a problem. Beschreiben Sie kurz Ihr Problem und tippen Sie auf Upload. Unsere Support-Techniker helfen Ihnen gerne weiter.

I like a lot of things. To make sure I understand everything correctly, I translate the texts into German. An app of this financial magnitude should be available in many languages. I find this to be a very big shortcoming. Vieles gefällt mir gut. Damit ich alles richtig verstehe, übersetze ich mir die Texte ins Deutsche. Eine App in dieser finanziellen Größenordnung sollte in vielen Sprachen verfügbar sein. Dies empfinde ich als ein sehr großes Manko. Me gusta mucho. Para asegurarme de que lo entiendo todo correctamente, traduzco los textos al alemán. Una aplicación de esta magnitud financiera debería estar disponible en muchos idiomas. Me parece una carencia muy grande.

Totally want to use this app. But you can’t subscribe month at a time from the app. It looks like you have selected monthly, but they are charging you the yearly rate. No way to change it, so I can’t shell out the $100 for the year price with a short trial first.
29 July, 2023 at 6:23 AM
Hi, and thanks for the feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience this situation may have caused. Our research shows that with most users, our app helps achieve significant positive changes in their lifestyle and well-being within several months. Our app is more effective in the long term, as the self-training algorithm needs to get to know you, and it takes time and data about your body's state, activities, habits, etc. to form baselines. Moreover, some features only become available later on in your journey with our app, when there is enough data to provide you with interesting findings (e.g. personalized research that shows how two data sets affect each other based on your individual health and wellness data from the sources you've connected to the app). That's why we're going to gradually remove the monthly plan from all platforms, and we've already archived it in App Store.

This app is remarkable
Earthbear80
I can’t adequately convey how much this app has helped me improve my quality of life. I’ve got PTSD and consequently, an overactive autonomic nervous system. It is hard for me to connect with my body and listen to the signals it is giving me. Enter Welltory, which has more or less become my ground-truthing barometer of self. I rely on it constantly, to inform me on if what I’m experiencing is, say, truly sickness, or if it’s just my stress levels wreaking havoc on my body. I’ll often find I’m fine enough to do more exercise, as my body is in good shape and what I’m experiencing is just too much ANS activity and fight/flight/freeze response. And then, I feel better listening to the app informing me more or less on what is neuropathic pain, and what isn’t. Thank you Welltory - you’ve changed my life for the better! I love the layout, the exams, the monitoring and the occasional research results you provide. I also love how you link to actual medical research, enabling me to always learn and grow.

Helpful during trial but…

App thinks I slept only 1.5 hours after being woken up by before midnight and never considered sleep after midnight. Major issue is having paid for an annual Pro version from email promo, confirmed by Apple Pay, had no upgrade to my app nor instructions on how to apply it… many features from trial turned off, now just nagware. No response from company to promo email address.

I don’t know how they managed to get all the readings correct but it was definitely on point with how I felt physically mentally and emotionally. It analyzed my health and was given results to read.Explained what everything meant. Which was great. Also offers more if u subscribe which I will try to do soon. Can’t wait to see what else it can tell me about my health and help me to get myself on a more healthier road. Would definitely recommend this app.

Estoy seguro que es una magnífica aplicación, pero desgraciadamente la he tenido que desinstalar porque mi inglés es muy malo. Es increíble que no ofrezca el español en sus opciones.

¡Hola! Muchas gracias por tus comentarios! Agradecemos su revisión. La traducción completa de la aplicación es una montaña de trabajo, ya que tenemos una gran cantidad de contenido. Si tenemos suficientes solicitudes para traducir a su idioma, lo agregaremos a nuestra hoja de ruta con seguridad y probablemente lo traduciremos.

BeccaMcM7
I’ve been feeling miserably stressed while sleeping in the middle of the night when I should be most relaxed and it’s been impossible to explain to anyone. When I wake up miserable every night and try to figure out what’s going on I take my blood oxygen (it’s great) and I have learned I no problem with afib. So this makes zero sense! Now I finally have solid evidence that there is something wrong. I’m obviously not happy about it, but at least it explains the situation and gives me something I can investigate and show my doctor. I can’t thank you enough.

Bonjour et merci pour votre avis. Nous sommes désolés pour tout inconvénient causé. Notre application s'est avérée avoir un impact positif sur le mode de vie et le bien-être des utilisateurs après plusieurs mois d'utilisation. L'algorithme d'auto-entraînement a besoin de temps pour apprendre à vous connaître, et plus il possède de données sur l'état, les activités et les habitudes de votre corps, plus il devient efficace. Certaines fonctionnalités peuvent ne pas être disponibles initialement, mais deviennent accessibles à mesure que l'application collecte plus de données, offrant des informations personnalisées. C'est pourquoi nous avons décidé de supprimer progressivement le forfait mensuel de toutes les plateformes, et il a déjà été archivé dans l'App Store.

Kurzes Feedback 😁 Sehr zufrieden keine Frage,immer mal wieder Angebote und nebenbei bester Support von Mitbenutzer und von Welltory selbst 💯 könnte man nicht nach und nach die App auf deutsch machen,also als nächstes die Oberfläche was schon viel Input und Zeit in Anspruch nimmt und nach und nach die Ärztlichen Tests ?! Als Verbesserungsvorschlag Bitte von Welltory in andere Apps den Zugriff erlauben über IFFTTT funktioniert es sehr schlecht bis gar nicht und wenn es funktioniert dann nur mit heftigen Abo und nur wenn IFFTTT im Hintergrund läuft bzw. über diese App es zu steuern Bitte unbedingt nachbessern!!! 🙏🏻

Thank you for the review! We understand your point about the price. Welltory is a sophisticated product. It packs complex algorithms and decades of health research. Making the app efficient and convenient for every user requires a highly qualified, world-class team, including in-house health scientists, data researchers, and engineers whose work is not and should not be cheap. We also have a free version of the app and promos with discounts fairly often; stay tuned for those!

Moderately helpful, but I wish there were more suggestions on how to improve numbers besides ‘meditate for ten minutes.’ Also, I already have a subscription yet it constantly prompts you to upgrade and has a 40% off banner at the top pretty much every time you open the app. That should not happen on something I am already paying for.

Правда, без доступа к платной подписке трудно понять, насколько полную картину она дает. Разработчикам было бы здорово дать ее на тестовый период, чтобы понять, за что именно надо платить.

Здравствуйте, и спасибо за высокую оценку и отзыв. У нас есть 5-дневный бесплатный пробный период с некоторыми функциями Welltory PRO, который начинается автоматически сразу после регистрации в приложении. В первые пять дней вы получаете полный анализ замеров вариабельности сердечного ритма (ВСР) и записей артериального давления. По окончании пробного периода вы можете бесплатно делать замеры один раз в день с базовым набором показателей.

Essential wellbeing toolkit …
CoachKidd
If you’re serious about your wellness or simply curious about your health, I highly recommend Welltory. It was recommended to me some time ago and I use it to compliment a few other apps to monitor my response to life and stresses. As a highly sensitive person, Welltory helps me calibrate my physiology, so I can take care of my needs in a healthy way.

Thank you so much for your positive review! We're thrilled to hear that Welltory has been beneficial for you in monitoring your health and stress levels. Keep up the great work in taking care of your wellness!

Hi, thanks a lot for your positive review! We're thrilled to hear that Welltory has been beneficial for you in monitoring your health. As per the question about the kcal amount, it sounds realistic, but if you want to double-check, you can check the Active Calorie data in your Apple Health — we take that data from there.

I can’t figure out to take my blood pressure?
01 July, 2023 at 9:12 PM
Hi there! Welltory can give you a complete and accurate analysis of blood pressure. But please note that you can't measure your blood pressure with Welltory — you'll need to use a blood pressure monitor. You can read about it in this article: https://help.welltory.com/en/articles/3878866. If you enter your blood pressure regularly — automatically or by hand — you'll be able to track trends on charts or in the blood pressure log (monthly blood pressure report), see what impacts your results, and help your doctor understand how well your treatment is working.

Interesting feedback
4 Goldens
I'm a body systems nerd. I have worked out for decade including body building. Nutrition, muscle building, and knowledge of how the systems work are always important focus of research. Once I learned that I had auto-immune diseases that impacted my health, learning became more impacted. I was skeptical when I discovered Wellatory. I used it and over time it consistently correlated to my body's feedback and my mental state. There are times that it can't get a reading. I don't know if it's really an issue with me or Wellatory so I've reserved a star for that. Plus it always says I'm relaxed! That particular reading never varies and I don't think it works. I'm not always in a relaxed state. Overall, I recommend this app. It's worth the money for the information provided. I'm looking forward to rating it 5 starts in the future.
30 June, 2023 at 8:32 PM
Hi there, thanks a lot for the feedback! To make sure the algorithm used in our app knows about your condition, please, pass the test named "Health Risk Assessment Survey". You can find it in the Introductory Self-tests section. Also, it might be worth passing all relevant tests in the Health Self-tests section. To access these tests, go to Menu — Self-tests. As per the messages that say that you're relaxed, please note that heart rate variability (HRV) doesn’t reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is experiencing at the moment. This is exactly why HRV measurements are helpful. We're happy to hear that we've been helping you monitor your health!

This app has been so eye opening at how poorly I take care of nyself it makes me be accountable for that. I’ve ask my Dr and she recommends this also and with that I trust it because I tend to already fool the my results end up each reading and the best part is it’s free if you want more depth of your readings there’s a cost but it’s well worth the try and see you will rely on it also im always looking at my watch I have the face setting to this and it’s cool to see you blood movements not sure how to explain just check it out! I’m A believer and appreciate the service !👏👏👏

How do I pay monthly
27 June, 2023 at 1:44 AM
Hi there, and thanks for your review. We're sorry for any inconvenience caused. Our app has proven to positively impact users' lifestyles and well-being after several months of use. The self-training algorithm needs time to get to know you, and the more data it has about your body's state, activities, and habits, the more effective it becomes. Additionally, some features only become available after you've been using the app for a while, and it has enough data to provide you with some personalized insights. Some features may not be available initially, but become accessible as the app collects more data, offering personalized insights. That's why we decided to gradually remove the monthly plan from all the platforms, and it has already been archived in App Store. You can still choose from other subscription plans available in App Store if you prefer to manage your subscriptions there.

Insights
Annoyed..-///-..
The app provides great data and insights — when I can read them. Wish there were settings to adjust the size / color contrast - maybe even a read view that turns longer posts into easy to read text. Parts of short one or two line posts are often underlined with a think colored line. On my phone it means the tiny font it’s typed in is crossed out so I can’t read it at all. Other than that- really love the app and the accompanying watch face.

Amazing insights and UI/UX!
Ana Sofia Pinho
I’m really enjoying this app! The insights create clarity and allow me to navigate my days better. I wish that we could note that we have ME/CFS to understand better its influence in our energy levels and better evaluate our intelectual capacity, as I sometimes don’t think that the results correspond to how I’m feeling. If you don’t have chronic fatigue, this shouldn’t be relevant to you. The team really put a ton of effort in all the interactions and the content to explain very thoughtfully and clearly each parameter.

Not sure
Shane_O_Mac42
It always shows me in the red even when I feel calm and relaxed.
20 June, 2023 at 6:41 AM
Hello, thank you for the feedback! There are several reasons why you might be getting high-stress heart rate variability (HRV) results. 1. You only have three manual measurements, i.e. you mostly have automatic (background) Apple Watch measurements. Apple Watch takes such measurements only when you're calm and relaxed, not moving and your heart rate isn't too high. This is the case when you're asleep but doesn't happen too often during the day. Besides, it might happen when you're calm but talking or doing something without moving much. These are not optimal conditions for HR) measurements, which might be the reason why you see high-stress results. That's why our data scientists recommend measuring manually. And you can use Apple Watch for manual measurements as well. Please use your watch for manual HRV measurements. 2. Another important aspect that should be considered is the time of the measurements. To see your baseline body state before any factors influenced it, our data scientists recommend measuring manually in the morning, 10-15 minutes after you wake up but before any other activities. And it's better to do it regularly. Please read how to take accurate HRV measurements here. This will not only show you how your body is doing when the day starts but will also help our algorithm interpret your other measurements during the day according to your baseline. Please note that it's normal that our energy depletes and our stress level increases during the day after various external and internal factors affected it.

Great app with lots of daily insights
Eholiveira
I love this app! I decided to start getting fitness seriously last year and this app has been a great companion to guide me with daily insights about my health in general, including cardio and sleeping patterns, two of my main goals of improvement. i read a lot about HRV, a concept I didn’t have, and using it with my Apple Watch got me to improve dramatically my VO2Max, track stress levels during the day, which I can address immediately with meditation and breathing exercises, seeing the results right away in consecutive measurements. It’s really a good positive reinforcement to see that 5 min of meditation effectively reduced your stress levels! I wish though that there was a way to see the partial progress on daily goals. It’s a bit frustrating to only see the next day that you fell a bit short of a goal, something you could have addressed if you knew it…the day before! Just a minor improvement on a great, feature packed app, I totally recommend it.

Hallo! Danke für Ihre Rückmeldung! Wir freuen uns über Ihre Bewertung. Die vollständige App-Übersetzung ist ein Berg an Arbeit, da wir über riesige Mengen an Inhalten verfügen. Wenn wir genügend Anfragen für eine Übersetzung in Ihre Sprache haben, werden wir diese auf jeden Fall in unsere Roadmap aufnehmen und wahrscheinlich übersetzen. Basierend auf der monatlichen Zahlung zeigen unsere Untersuchungen, dass unsere App bei den meisten Nutzern innerhalb weniger Monate zu deutlichen positiven Veränderungen in ihrem Lebensstil und Wohlbefinden führt. Unsere App ist auf lange Sicht effektiver, da der Selbsttrainingsalgorithmus Sie kennenlernen muss und Zeit und Daten über den Zustand Ihres Körpers, Ihre Aktivitäten, Gewohnheiten usw. benötigt, um Basislinien zu erstellen. Darüber hinaus werden einige Funktionen erst später auf Ihrer Reise mit unserer App verfügbar, wenn genügend Daten vorhanden sind, um Ihnen interessante Erkenntnisse zu liefern (z. B. personalisierte Forschung, die zeigt, wie sich zwei Datensätze auf der Grundlage Ihrer individuellen Gesundheits- und Wellnessdaten gegenseitig beeinflussen Quellen, die Sie mit der App verbunden haben). Aus diesem Grund werden wir den Monatsplan nach und nach von allen Plattformen entfernen und haben ihn bereits im App Store archiviert. Wenn Sie Ihre Abonnements lieber über den App Store verwalten möchten, können Sie andere dort verfügbare Pläne auswählen.

Welltory has a wealth of information and analytical data concerning your overall health. However, I feel there should be a little more clarity and explanation of the data being presented. Otherwise It’s a good tool to help you make some informed choices about your health and life patterns.

Love this app
IDconnor
I have used the app for around 18m now and find it very insightful. However I’ve only just realised the DRASTIC difference in readings compared to if taken lying down or sitting up. Eg lying down I always get full red alert readings and sitting up is more likely to be green and within range? No idea why, yet I’d advise all to test this and then ensure you take readings in the same posture for comparative consistency.
17 June, 2023 at 9:21 AM
HI, and thank you for the very detailed review and high rating! You're right — we recommend taking measurements in the same position. As for the difference, it might be due to several reasons: different measurement accuracy score, changing balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic parts of the autonomic nervous systems, taking measurements while lying down when your body state is shifting.

Sleep insight is great but you are very expensive!
16 June, 2023 at 5:10 AM
Hi, thank you for the feedback! We understand your point about the price. Welltory is a sophisticated product. It packs complex algorithms and decades of health research. Making the app efficient and convenient for every user requires a highly qualified, world-class team, including in-house health scientists, data researchers, and engineers whose work is not and should not be cheap. We also have a free version of the app and promos with discounts fairly often; stay tuned for those!

Accurate Health Insights with Notable Impact
BKP083
Welltory goes above and beyond when it comes to delivering health insights. The accuracy of their data interpretation is truly impressive. Other apps in the market often feel hit-or-miss with their health data analysis, but Welltory consistently matches my personal feelings and physical state, which is a testament to their advanced algorithms and deep understanding of health metrics. Moreover, the app doesn't just stop at providing insights. It educates users daily, sharing valuable knowledge that has led to noticeable improvements in both my physical and mental health. This feature not only fosters a deeper understanding of personal health but also empowers users to make informed decisions about their lifestyle and well-being. Despite the subscription cost, I consider it a worthy investment. The wealth of insights, education, and improvements to health far outweigh the price point. It's not often you come across an app that offers such a comprehensive and accurate health analysis. If you're someone who values their health and seeks to understand and improve it, Welltory is a must-have. It truly sets a new standard in health and wellness apps.

Very informative!
Ygeezy
I tried one other stress app before Welltory and Welltory for the win. I have only been using it for a few days but I love all of the informative tips and articles that are personal to where you are and real time actionable things you can do to change your stress levels. I have seen some reviews complaining about the price and to be honest I was hesitant. I think the app would be more accessible to people of different economic backgrounds with a monthly plan. That said, I decided to purchase because I want to see how stress is impacting my body since stress has caused illness for me in the past. There is a saying that what gets measured gets managed. So far, Welltory has been an effective tool for me to pay attention to my stress levels and do something about it.

Put in a find key so I can get blood pressure and heart rate
kentofcantubury
facing difficulty in navigating through the application. I can understand how challenging it can be to find the information you need, especially with a learning disability. It is great to hear that the application has been helpful in identifying your stress levels and other heart-related information. Perhaps one solution to simplify the information overload could be to customize the application's dashboard to your personal preferences. You could have your most frequently accessed data displayed on the main screen, and other data can be accessed through specific tabs. Additionally, a #search function could be added that allows you to type in what you're looking for and brings up relevant information. hopefully, the developers can take your feedback into consideration to improve the user experience for people with similar challenges in the future. What I really want is my heart rate I want my blood pressure and I want my sine wave function all in one place. It’s very difficult in the settings to use it. If you could enlighten me what to do, I would appreciate it. Eyes started studying hearts in the seventh grade. When I wrote a paper on the heart I’m an expert on hearts I have a gerontology degree I study Mindbody Medicine I know a lot, but this thing has shown me things that I never even thought of before I Schopenhauer said Genius is describing someone something that no one else has even imagined

Gives me a Baseline, particularly when I’m in doubt. Understanding how the nervous system works as a PhD who has gone to medical school, I can say it’s nice to have a system that I can measure specific levels that you can get at least a baseline of where you are. Keep in mind if you’re having a heart attack or stroke, it’s particularly hard for your nervous system to be balanced, so a system like this that can help you keep an eye on symptoms has been helpful.

Glad I have it. This app makes me more aware of my health. And I’d like more check-ins per day. My Apple Watch is always on but readouts are few. I’m lying in bed sick and the report shows all blue and says I’m focused and healthy. Time for exercise… huh? But then. I’m Sitting in a meeting with my boss who is chewing out the room for 20 minutes and my graph comes back as totally stressed and im sick. So how can it be so accurate when I’m trying to hide being upset In a meeting - and it knows. But when I’m sick and tired it tells me it’s time to get some exercise and my focus is wonderful.

Hi there. Thank you for your feedback! We’re happy to hear that the app is useful to you. You can have symptoms and still have a high Health score. A high level of the Health metric can mean that you are doing fine even if you are experiencing symptoms. Kindly note that Welltory is not a medical app, and it can't be used for diagnostic purposes or as a substitute for professional medical advice. However, if the quality of your measurements is high, they should reflect how your body's doing pretty decently.
